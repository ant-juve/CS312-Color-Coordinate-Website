      <p>I am the General Manager at a facility management company and have returned to school to pursue my computer science degree. I aspire to obtain my masterâ€™s degree in computer science at CSU, focusing on AI or blockchain technology. While I have many achievements in my professional career, my highest accomplishment is my loving wife and beautiful children, who made it all possible with their support.</p>
